# Background

## Project 
MINDSCAPE: Modeling of infectious network dynamics for surveillance, control and prevention enhancement

## Description 
This file reads in necessary data and identifies variables of interest for building a multivariate logistic regression model to evaluate C diff risk among hospitalized patients. The resulting dataframe (`df.CDI`) contains binary indicators for CDI risk factors. Variables include:

  * `ID` --> each patient's unique de-identified encounter ID 
  * `readmit` --> whether patient had a prior hospital admission in the last 30 days
  * `ED_dispo` --> whether pt was admitted from Emergency Dept (ED) ???
    - NOTE: UNCLEAR! VERIFY / LEO WHAT THIS SHOULD BE TO INDICATE THAT PT WAS ADMITTED TO ED!
  * `age_gte_65` --> whether pt is aged 65 years or older at time of hospitalization
  * `PPI` --> whether pt received proton pump inhibitor (PPI) during hospital stay
  * `GAS` --> whether pt received gastric acid suppressants and laxatives (GAS) during hospital stay
    - NOTE: This includes "ANTACIDS", "LAXATIVES AND CATHARTICS", and "LAXATIVES, LOCAL/RECTAL"
  * `ABX` --> whether pt received antibiotics during hospital stay 
    - NOTE: THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE OUTPATIENT ABX - ONLY THOSE DURING HOSPITALIZATION. 
  * `DBM` --> whether pt is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DBM) 
    - NOTE: DO NOT USE! ONLY HAVE DBM DX FOR COVID POSITIVE PTS.

# Clean `med` table - deselect unnecessary variables, change to appropriate variable type
```{r Clean `med` table}
# With med table, create new variables to indicate whether pt received PPI, GAS, and/or ABX
med <- med %>%

med_taken_before_HAI
# Rather than number of PPI/GAS/ABX, should this just be a binary variable indicating receipt of PPI/GAS/ABX (coded as 1=yes or 0=no)? Section commented above handles this. Can remove this chunk of code if decide it's better to have frequency counts for PPI/GAS/ABX. 
```

# Clean `dx` table - create table `dbm` to indicate diabetes mellitus (DBM) diagnoses
```{r Clean `dx` table, create table to indicates DBM dx}
dbm <- dx %>% 
  mutate(DBM = if_else(dx_group=="DIABETES MELLITUS", 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(deid_enc_id) %>% 
  summarize(n_dbm = sum(DBM)) %>% 
  mutate(DBM = if_else(n_dbm>=1, 1, 0)) %>% 
  select(-n_dbm)

sum(dbm$DBM)
# 406 patients diagnosed with diabetes 
```

NOTE: Only have diabetes diagnoses for 1,210 out of 54,955 patients. Missing data on DBM diagnosis for ~97% of patients. Only have DBM data for Covid-positive patients. Checked demographics and events table, and diabetes dx not listed as variable. Would need Leo to re-pull data gathering diabetes dx for ALL patients. 

# Join `dm`, `med`, and `dbm` tables and assign to `df_CDI`
```{r Merge all tables}
df_CDI <- dm %>% 
  inner_join(med_taken_before_HAI, by = 'deid_enc_id') %>% 
  left_join(dbm, by = "deid_enc_id") %>%          # Left join dm and dbm
  mutate(DBM = ifelse(is.na(DBM), 0, DBM)) %>%    # If DBM=NA then assign 0, otherwise, leave as-is
  rename(ID = deid_enc_id)                        # Rename to ID for convenience
```

# Preview and explore resulting dataset
```{r Preview and explore `df_CDI`}
# Preview dataset and check variables types 
str(df_CDI)

# Use DT package to explore dataset
DT::datatable(df_CDI)
```

# Calculate descriptives for categorical variables in `df_CDI`
```{r Create table one of descriptives}
tableone <- CreateCatTable(data=df_CDI, vars=c("readmit", "ED_dispo", "age_gte_65", "cdif_gt_2_days", "PPI", "GAS", "ABX", "DBM"))

print(tableone, showAllLevels = T, noSpaces = T)

# For binary variables, 1 = YES and 0 = NO. 
```

# Save resulting dataset `df_CDI` as .csv file 
```{r Save resulting dataset as .csv file}
write_csv(df_CDI, "/Users/sreynolds2/Documents/GitHub/MS-CDI_Risk/MS-CDI_Risk/data/clean/df_CDI_risk_model.csv")
```

# Ctonigency tables
```{r Contingency table and OR}
table(df_CDI$HACDIF, df_CDI$age_gte_65)

chisq.test(df_CDI$HACDIF, df_CDI$age_gte_65)
# p-value < .05, thus, HACIF are NOT independent, aka they are related

fisher.test(df_CDI$HACDIF, df_CDI$age_gte_65)
# p-value < .05, thus, HACIF are NOT independent, aka they are related
# OR=1.65, meaning patients that are 65 and older are 1.65x more likely to be diagnosed with HA-CDIF than those who are under 65 years old
```


# Next Steps 

  * Create multivariate logistic regression model, divide data into 3 chunks/time periods (e.g. 2019, 2020, 2021)
    + 1 chunk used to train model, the other 2 used to evaluate model performance (e.g. 2019 chunk used to train model, while 2020-2021 used to test model performance)
  * Evaluate "model creep" or how much the optimized model changes over time? 
  * Question: What proportion of C diff cases occurred 2+ days after admission vs. within 2 days of admission? 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Idea of what next steps would look like... first have to normalize/transform data and meet assumptions of logistic regression... 

# For example, first look at correlation between age >= 65 and c diff dx. 
cor(df_CDI$age_gte_65, df_CDI$HACDIF, use = "complete.obs", method = "kendall")

m1 <- glm(formula = HACDIF ~ age_gte_65 + PPI + GAS + ABX, 
          data = df_CDI, 
          family = binomial)

summary(m1)
```
